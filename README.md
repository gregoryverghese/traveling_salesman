# Traveling Salesman

A number of solutions to the classic travelling salesman NP-hard formulation; traveling salesman wishes to visit every city exactly once, 
then return to their starting point with the minimal distance travelled. Approaches: 
  
  * hill climbing& approach
  * heuristic algorithms

### Data representation

Data is included in `city-data.txt`, containing the latitudes and longitudes of the fifty state capitals of the U.S.A.  Each line contains:
- the name of the state, 
- the name of the city, 
- the latitude, and 
- the longitude. 

It represents the path the salesman follows, starting with the first city in the list and ending back at the first city in the list.
